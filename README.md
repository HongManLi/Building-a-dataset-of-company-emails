# Calling-the-NZBN-API
Part of the work I did for my internship at Ivise

This piece of code will call the NZBN companies office API and retrieve every company that includes the term "Plumb" in its company title as a dataframe. Additionally, information about the shareholders, directors, registered address, and registration date will also be included.

The API key has been removed.
